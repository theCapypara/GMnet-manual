Conclusion / What's next
------------------------

You now learned everything there is to know.

Multiplayer with GMnet ENGINE might be a little bit different that what
you are used to, but once you got the hang of it, the possibilites are
endless.

| Try extending the demo project we just created with some features.
| Why not start with our challenge? Fix the player overlay and the chat
  to display the name of the players corectly, no matter what room they
  are in.

Play around with the engine for a bit, and eventually you will master
it!

If you have any questions, find bugs or have feature suggestions, follow
the instructions in the `Support <index/#support>`__ section.

If you want to learn even more advanced trics, like sending your own
custom packets, check out the "`Extending the Engine / Advanced
Use <more/extending>`__" section.

Have fun creating awesome multiplayer games! And if you do, don't forget
to tell us, we really want to see, what you can come up with.
