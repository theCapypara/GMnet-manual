Implementing GMnet PUNCH in your game
-------------------------------------

To implement GMnet PUNCH in your game copy all **scripts** and the
behaviour of all the objects to your game and adjust them to your needs.
When copying the behaviour, you can simply use your existing
server/client objects and add the codes at the top of your events.
